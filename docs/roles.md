# Roles and Surface Types

## Roles:
Roles are generated by the internal PEC compiler and assigned to blocks.
These roles are used to decide which set of textures the walls texture will be chosen from.
Blocks can have multiple roles. A block surrounded completely by air can be a ceiling, floor, and wall.
**Important: The internal role application system is still in developement. Some roles chosen may not be 100% accurate.**

### List of roles
* `wall`
* `floor`
* `ceiling`

## Surface Types *not implemented yet*
Surface types are a lot like roles, but they account for portalability.
Packages may implement their own surface types which can be applied from within the editor.

### Default surface types
* `white`
* `black`
